# N64 Input Display

A simple input display for Nintendo 64 controllers, made in [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) 11.3. Check out the `main` branch of this git repository for the Switch Pro version.

Controller images are based off of a [retrobit tribute](https://scale.coolshop-cdn.com/product-media.coolshop-cdn.com/AC546S/8d4ce9c20fb9418b8c715e0b0a3ef416.jpg/f/retro-bit-tribute-64-usb-green.jpg) which I own, which I believe is itself based off of the hori pad mini. Cool controllers that I think are more comfortable than the original N64 controllers

## Usage

1. Connect your N64 controller and get it to output XInput (I use a Mayflash N64 to USB adapter and [XOutput](https://github.com/csutorasa/XOutput))
2. Use Love2D to run the program (see [Getting Started](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) for more details)
3. Add the window to your OBS layout (or whatever software you're using)
4. Chroma key out the background
5. ???
6. Profit

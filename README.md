# Switch Pro Input Display

A simple input display for Nintendo Switch pro controllers, made in [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) 11.3.

Example usage: https://youtu.be/zTB6cEvgZSA

I made this a long time ago but never published it anywhere. Maybe somebody will find it useful :)

## Usage

1. Connect your Nintendo Switch pro controller
2. Use Love2D to run the program (see [Getting Started](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) for more details)
3. Add the window to your OBS layout (or whatever software you're using)
4. Chroma key out the background
5. ???
6. Profit

I connect my pro controller using a [Mayflash MagicNS](https://mayflash.com/product/showproduct.php?id=30) to use XInput for most games. It also allows your to swap the AB/XY buttons to match the labels if you would like. If you've swapped the buttons, press "x" on your keyboard (while the input display window is in focus) to swap them on this input display as well.

I made this a while ago and it's like <200 lines of code and a few traced images, do whatever you want lol
